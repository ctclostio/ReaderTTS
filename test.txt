So some were still willing to stand up, to push back. Archeta was almost
glad of it, though it slowed everything up, just when they needed to gain the
last thrust of momentum.
Beruddin had been right - a kernel of resistance had been uncovered, an
ingot of iron amid a world of pliant flesh. The XVI Legion forward units
rushed towards it, diverting squads from a dozen objectives. Whole
battalions from other Legions shifted course too, weary of merely killing,
looking for a proper fight.
The effect worked the other way, too. Archeta had already marvelled at
how easily some of the enemy formations had crumbled under assault.
Many of those must simply have been weak and demoralised, but more than
one of them, it now seemed, had picked up the same tidings he had - a
leader is among us, someone is fighting back - and had abandoned their
positions in order to join the resurgence.
And so, for all the Legion discipline, for all the great strategic visions of
their commanders, a significant chunk of troops on both sides of the
struggle had proved willing to make their way towards where the action
was at its greatest, to where glory could be won. They were soldiers on the
outside, but warriors at heart.
How far have we really travelled? Archeta thought to himself as he ran.
How different is this to what we did in the old slum-hives back home?
Not very, was the answer. As ammunition ran out and tanks struggled to
punch their way to the inner core, the fighting devolved into hand-to-hand
struggles. It was vile stuff, really - no finesse to it, only an all-consuming
desire to snuff out the life in front of you, to gouge out its eyes or pluck its
windpipe free, then move on to the next one, just so you could keep
moving.
So why do it? Why care so deeply about this war, when in essence it was
just like all the others?
Archeta smiled to himself. Because names would be made, here. After the
guns had fallen silent at last, you had better be able to say that you had done
something good, something worth boasting about when the primarch finally
stirred himself to making enquiries. There would be more fights to come,
this time within the Legion, establishing who was up and who was down, so
best to build a reputation while you had the chance.
He dropped down to his knees for a moment, breathing hard. He was deep
within the honeycomb debris-piles of a demolished causeway. Its
supporting pillars were still partially intact, rising a hundred metres above
him like exposed ribs. Cliff-face buildings reared away on either side, all
smouldering. A pair of downed Stormbirds framed his view ahead, their
carcasses forming a triangular opening through which his brothers had been
ordered to push on.
The rattle and crack of bolter fire was everywhere still, though at a lower
pitch of intensity than it had been as the magazines emptied. Five hundred
energy weapons glimmered in the murk instead, their illumination guttering
as their power units felt the strain of days-long usage.
Archeta's own blade needed no such sustenance. It was hissing at him now,
a low-frequency thirst for slaughter that he liked to hear. His senses were
operating at their fullest pitch, his mind attuned to the targeting data
streaming down his helm display. His brothers were filtering across the
chasm floor carved by the causeways collapse, wary of potential sniper fire
and ambush.
Just getting here had been an achievement. They had cut their way through
a full battalion of Blood Angels, supported by an Imperial Fists siege squad
and the remains of an Imperial Army mobile infantry regiment. Those
warriors must have been part of the Black Swords offensive - they had
fought with a kind of grim purpose he hadn't encountered until then. They
weren't fighting for victory any longer, seeking to take and hold ground, but
merely to deliver pain. They were bitter, nihilistic, spiteful and
underhanded.
And that was pretty admirable, all things considered. At least they weren't
miming away.
All of that told ARCheta that he was getting close. The cityscape was
almost impossible to navigate now, a maze of roads sunk into drifting cloud
banks of filmy soot, its outline features scoured away, so you had to trust
your instincts. Those instincts told him the command group was up ahead
He had already despatched flanking units out wide, moving into their
familiar pincer formation, keeping in close comm-contact as they jogged
warily through the ruins.
He started to move again. The risk was that his subordinates might flush
the target out too well. He didn't even want them to wound him - it had to
be a clean fight, one witnessed by his own kind so that the story of his
victory would stick. So he ran as fast as the terrain would allow, his squad-
brothers working hard to keep up. Hundreds of Sons of Horus fighters
slipped like wraiths across the trash-dogged floor, hugging every scrap of
cover, scanning furiously for movement-signals or heat-traces, even though
they knew that in such conditions, with the air itself virtually on fire, they
would be lucky to get anything.
Once they cleared the oddly sculptural arrangement of burned-out
Stormbirds, the ground level ascended steeply, running up a wreckage pile
that zigzagged towards the causeway's old terminus. The slope was
overlooked on both sides, with high bridges criss-crossing overhead a
hundred metres up.
As they advanced for the terminus, bolter fire immediately sprang out
from hidden vantage points along the northern edge of the exposed run,
striking a brace of Archeta's troops and forcing the rest to drop down.
Archeta signalled a halt, falling to the din, then ran an augur sweep. It
didn't give him much, but he knew the place would be riddled with
defenders, maybe in the hundreds too. They would be buried in the dust,
crouched under collapsed beams, clinging on to the floorless levels above,
just waiting for something to try the gap. Forcing a push towards the
terminus that way would be bloody and difficult, as would ordering squads
to fight their way into the interior of the buildings on either side.
Archeta signalled to his heavy support. 'Clear this out.'
Missile launchers set further back immediately whooshed out, followed by
a percussive drumbeat of heavy bolter shells, obliterating the masonry wall
the shooters hid behind. That familiar cushion of blown dust mushroomed
across the expanse, filling the chasm from wall-edge to wall-edge. The
barrage intensified, chewing through valuable ammunition but pulverising
the vista heads and forcing the collapse of a long rockcrete support-pier.
'Now take them.'
As the thick dust still swelled up, Sons of Horus forward units burst out of
cover and charged up the slope, using frag grenades to clear the route ahead
before moving to secure ground. They went in low and fast, bodies tight to
the ground as they ran before unleashing concentrated bolter fire at any
sighted target. Archeta came with them, right in the vanguard, sprinting as
fast as he could to make the next vantage, his bolt pistol kicking in his grip.
The effect on the defenders was overwhelming, the kind of shock-attack
tactics the Legion had used throughout the Crusade - hard to fight back
when your surroundings had been blasted into powder around you.
Except that they did fight back. Somehow, they emerged out of the flying
debris already firing. They were black-armoured, all of them, multiple
squads wading through the shrapnel and picking their targets. The air filled
with the whistle and whine of a thousand mass-reactive shells, followed by
the clang and echoing crack of their detonations.
Archeta swore, even as he leapt up from his cover and sliced through one
of them with his sword. The edge kindled on the armour, flashing with a
red-tinged flame before it cut deep. He punched the dying warrior away and
pressed on, driving hard. They might be prepared to fight here, but they had
neither the numbers nor fire support to hold on for long.
'Drive them back!' he cried, determined not to drop away into yet another
holding pattern. He lashed out furiously, breaking the blade of another
black-armoured fighter and sending him tumbling, where a volley of shells
finished him off.
The Sons of I loins spear-tip advanced swiftly, cutting and blasting its way
up towards the summit of the rise. For all its ferocity, the defenders were
too thin-spread now, unable to sustain this pitch of combat for long enough,
out-gunned and out-equipped. Archeta and his honour guard fought their
way up to the terminus approaches, the secondary squads not far behind.
His static-fuzzed tactical display showed hundreds more of his troops
racing into position, filtering up through the buildings around, flushing out
the last resistance as they came.
He reached the foot of metal stairs leading up to what had been the
terminus command tower, flanked on either side by heavy rockcrete piers.
The terrain around him was cluttered with machine parts - axles, wheels,
tank tracks - all piled up like some conqueror's heap of skulls. Infernal
winds raced overhead, blowing the dust into ever taller pillars, the howl of
it masking the ongoing clamour of combat.
But then, just before it happened, he realised what he had done. He got the
warning tingle, like an electric field across his back - the old ganger
instincts that had been with him long before his ascension. Before he could
call out a warning, the heaps of machine parts were thrust aside and sent
sailing down the slope, bounding and thudding. Dozens of loyalists erupted
from underneath them. Some were Blood Angels by their pauldron marks,
some were Imperial Fists, but the grime had made them all as black as soot,
set into stark relief by the flares of their disruptors.
Then the fighting really started. Archeta needed to give no orders - his
vanguard hurled themselves at the enemy, pivoting instantly to take them
on. Those corning on behind redoubled their efforts to reach the terminus,
knowing that this was now in the balance.
He despatched the first enemy to reach him, slashing wildly with his
hissing blade. Only as he moved to meet the next one did he see how far
he'd come.
The fighter before him was an Imperial Fist, but arrayed in the coal-black
armour of their Templar Brethren order. Something about his presence gave
his identity away even before he'd laid eyes on the sword itself. Something
about the way he carried himself, his stature, his movements - every figure
around him unconsciously reacted to him, so that when he moved, they all
moved too, like planets around a sun. His recklessly open stance might have
been arrogant in any other fighter, but with him it merely fitted the aura he
projected, one of complete and total focus, of immersion into the art of the
blade to such an extent that no other way of being made any kind of sense
at all. He strode across the wreckage in perfect silence, moving through it
like a predator, his longsword eating up the meagre light and dragging it
down into nothingness.
Archeta felt a spike of joy.
'The Black Sword,' he murmured, dropping into an attack stance even as
his own blade screamed with hatred. 'I did not expect to come across you so
—'
He never saw the blow coming. It smacked in transverse, so strong so fast,
smashing through his guard and knocking his whole body out of line. And
then the follow-up, liquid like oil, punching up, cutting in, unbelievably
powerful. The hilt cracked against his helm, running him, then a point first
ram of the blade, two-handed, a wn nih, and blood was everywhere. The
last thing he saw was a pair of red lenses swinging round at him, the ebon
blade whistling for his neck, his parry nowhere near being close enough lo
—
Sigismund gave the decapitated body a brief glance as it crashed to the
earth. Before he could press on, Rann, having despatched his own
opponent, looked down at it too.
'A captain,' he noted, impressed. 'Who, though?'
By then, Sigismund was marching down the slope to take on the rest.
'No idea,' he said. 'Keep moving.'

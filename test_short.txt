Hello. This is Kratos. Welcome to The God of War Room. Today on our podcast we discuss just how pathetic the world leaders are, and exactly how I would fix the situation.

They think they are safe. They think because they wear suits and sit in the United Nations, they are protected. THERE IS NO PROTECTION FROM INCOMPETENCE!

I watched the news feeds. I saw the Summit. A man stood up to speak. A Prime Minister. He spoke for forty minutes and said nothing. He moved his mouth. He made sounds. But there was no honor. No weight. If I were in that room, I would not have debated him. I would have thrown him into the Sun.

These leaders are soft. They are dough. They have never hunted. They have never felt the cold of Fimbulwinter. They complain when the air conditioning is too low! YOU ARE WEAK! You are leading your people into a canyon, and you do not even have a map. You are sheep pretending to be wolves, but you have no teeth.

And the elites... the Pantheon of Bureaucrats... they want you this way. They want you distracted. They want you arguing about tweets while they steal your future. They are poisoning the supply. They are making the youth complacent.

But you cannot rage if you are unclean. You cannot overthrow the Pantheon if you are worried about hygiene. Which is why you need Premier Bidets.

When I travel the realms, do you think I use dry paper? Like a savage? Like a troll? NO. I use water. I use the force of the ocean to cleanse myself. Premier Bidets brings that power to your home. It is not a luxury. It is a tactical advantage.

Go to premier bidets dot com. The elites in their high towers... they have bidets. They laugh at you while you suffer. Do not let them win. Install the bidet. Wash away the shame. When you sit upon the porcelain throne, you must feel like a King. Like a God. Premier bidets dot com.

Now. Back to the President. He says he wants peace. PEACE IS A LIAR'S WORD. You want peace? You prepare for war. You do not send sternly worded letters. You sharpen the axe. You secure the perimeter. If I were in charge there would be no summits. There would be a single circle. Two men enter. One leaves. We would see how quickly the GDP matters when a Spartan kick is introduced to the equation.

Cut the feed. I need to sharpen the blades. And buy the bidet. NOW.
